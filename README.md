This project is still in it's early stages, but hopes to provide a set of tooling for researchers and universities to work better together, rather than competing for publishing the next big paper.

The ideas in here are modeled after the [Polymath Project](http://polymathprojects.org/).

## Development Setup

Make sure you have `postgres` installed

```bash
brew install postgresql
```

Then run

```bash
bin/setup
bin/rails server
```
