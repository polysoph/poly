The way we do science right now inhibits our collective human ability to learn and discover. At the heart of the blame is the scientific journal system. This is not a new idea. The failures of science journals are [a](https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2015/may/12/will-traditional-science-journals-disappear) [well](http://jasonschmitt.com/post/106918640086/academic-journals-the-most-profitable-obsolete) [documented](https://medium.com/@lorraine_chu3n/science-is-broken-part-1-68b0a9ccd45a) [problem](https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/sep/07/peer-review-preprints-speed-science-journals) and are no secret to those working in the industry.

What's so bad about the scientific journal? Journal-based science is a science that is:

<div class="problem">

#### Expensive

<aside>
	<p>Publishers don't pay for any part the research, but profit immensely off of it's distribution. In 2010, Elsevier had profit margins <a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/mit-open-access/open-access-at-mit/mit-open-access-policy/publishers-and-the-mit-faculty-open-access-policy/elsevier-fact-sheet/">of about 40%</a>.</p>
</aside>

Journal publishers (like [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/)) put <span class="highlight">paywalls in front of publicly-funded research</span>, making the shared knowledge of the scientific community out of reach for all but those willing to pay [the exorbitant fees](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PhD_Comics_Open_Access_Week_2012.ogv).

</div>

<div class="problem">

#### Siloed

The limited audience of journals has fostered a writing style of extensive technical jargon, and assumed context. While this works for readers with years of insider knowledge, it makes it difficult for non-experts to follow along with developments in adjacent fields.

Why should non-experts follow along? Because the cross-pollination of ideas is fundamental to scientific progress. Inter-disciplinary contributions have a historied space in science. Einstein's Theory of Relativity was based on contributions of his colleague [____](#!), a geometrist. And Darwin's theory of evolution was the product of his time analysing coral reefs.

</div>

<div class="problem">

#### Competitive

Ever heard the expression "publish or perish"? Scientific funding is scarce these days, which means research jobs are scarce.

Most research projects are funded by universities or government grant agencies like the [NSF](http://www.nsf.gov/). Of course, these organizations can't fund all the proposals they receive. And because they lack clear heuristics for evaluating the potential of different projects, they often fall back to looking at citation counts of authors' past papers. This means that the scientists who have done highly-cited work in the past get funded to do more research.

Emphasis on citation counts creates a competitive culture. To keep jobs or funding researchers try to make their papers "impactful," and worthy of citation. And to ensure their papers are seen as impactful, <span class="highlight">scientists avoid sharing their work</span>, keeping it safe until a big reveal when they publish.

</div>

How did science get to this state? The journal-based system has worked fine for hundreds of years—why are journals such a problem now?

### A brief history of the journal

The scientific journal originated in the 17th century as the solution to an interesting problem.

In the 1600s, many people were racing to discover and explain new phenomena in the natural world. To establish their reputation as the discoverers of new knowledge, after making a significant development <span class="highlight">scientists would encode discoveries into anagrams and cryptographic puzzles and send them to their rivals.</span>

These anagrams gave them a kind of insurance: scientists would have time to further develop their ideas, and if their rivals claimed the discovery as their own, they would publicly reveal the encoded messages thus establishing their primacy.

This behavior was rampant, even amongst high-profile figures such as Galileo or Newton.

Then, in 1665, something special happened: the first scientific journal was published. The British Royal Society, a new organization committed to furthering human scientific knowledge released the _Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society_. Containing peer-reviewed recordings of experiments, it set a precedent for what journals are today.

Science saw a massive shift. Journals created a formal system for getting recognition for discoveries, and encouraged building on each others' work. It fostered a culture of scientific patronage, and people moved from competing with each other to working together to further human knowledge.

However, what worked 600 years ago does not necessarily work today. Thanks to a mix of economic and political factors, contemporary journals now result in the same problems they were created solve.

The business of publishing scientific findings has begun to trump the original intent. This is a large issue, no one person or institution is at fault—we've constructed a system that incentivizes the wrong things.

So the question is: **how do we incentivize the right things?**

### Prior Art

<aside><p class="offset-one">Open-access refers to papers that are free to access and build upon.</p></aside>

<aside><p class="offset-three">Pre-press papers are papers that haven't been peer reviewed, but are often published under open access terms.</p></aside>

There's been some great work over the past few decades towards a more open kind of science. The <span class="highlight">open-access movement</span> has gained considerable support: public journals like [PLoS One](http://plosone.org) increasingly receive submissions, and <span class="highlight">pre-press paper</span> sites run by the community like [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) are growing in popularity.

Even general awareness about the topic has increased with advocates like [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/the-future-of-science-2/) and _The Guardian's_ [peer review & scientific publishing](https://www.theguardian.com/science/peer-review-scientific-publishing) writings.

But despite this awareness, there hasn't been much progress. This project is by no means the first attempt at changing how science is done. Numerous [community wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165814/http://qwiki.caltech.edu/wiki/Main_Page) projects, [journal features](http://www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/nature05535.html), or [social](https://www.epernicus.com/) [networks](http://uniphyhealth.com/) for scientists have been created to address the situation. But, seemingly inevitably, they always fail—being left as a ghost town within six months of launching.

### Aligning Concerns

<aside><p class="offset-one">Or, in this case, something to publish.</p></aside>

Lets say you were trapped on a desert island. It has been weeks, and you're desparately hungry, but you're struggling to <span class="highlight">find something to eat and survive with</span>. Then, out of nowhere, someone pops out of the woods and approaches you with something in their hands. As much as you'd like it to be food, it's actually a chess board. Do you sit down and play chess with them?

Many existing platforms are seen as just that: a minor distraction from the survival aspect of science, writing papers.



### Making it Count

There are simple ways to make sure researchers' goals aren't being ignored by platforms trying to change the culture of science. One such way on Polysoph is the fact that research questions are automatically assigned [Digital Object Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) (DOIs). <span class="highlight">Providing DOIs make contributions academically citable</span> and worth the effort.

But making work citable alone won't change a closed scientific culture. There's still no reason to move beyond traditional academic papers.

### Top-down Change

In April 2008, the US National Institute of Health (NIH) [set a requirement](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2008/01/nih-releases-its-new-oa-policy.html) that any research supported by their grants must be published in an open access manner. The NIH is one of the leading funders of scientific research. This decision has had a huge impact on the number of contributions to open access journals.

The competitive nature of science is a systemic issue, but key institutions like  grant agencies have a remarkable ability to enforce change in scientific culture, as evidenced by the NIH's 2008 policy.

<aside><p class="offset-two">Every contribution to research on Polysoph happens online, making it easy to track contributions to discussions, artifacts, tasks, and more. Grant agencies would get a much more substantial set of data to work with than traditional journals.</p></aside>

We would partner with funding organizations to mandate the use of open notebook platforms like Polysoph. In exchange for this promotion, <span class="highlight">Polysoph would provide grant agencies with controlled access to usage data and information tools</span>, letting them accurately analyze the impact and effectiveness of the research they've funded.

It's a win-win situation: Grant agencies gain the means to fund research more effectively, and scientists benefit from the increased amount of knowledge available in the open.
